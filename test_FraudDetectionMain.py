### Test Scenarios for `main` Function

Below are well-structured test scenarios designed to validate the business logic and analyze the behavior of the `main` function. These scenarios focus on the functionality and edge cases of the fraud detection pipeline, without diving into input data types (as Python is dynamically typed).

---

### Scenario 1: Verify Fraudulent Transaction Detection Logic
**Details:**
  **TestName**: test_detect_fraud_transactions  
  **Description**: This test evaluates if the pipeline correctly identifies and flags fraudulent transactions. Fraud detection logic is applied by the `detect_fraud` method, and the pipeline should only emit transactions flagged as "fraud."

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:**  
  - Mock Kafka consumer with a stream of sample JSON transactions (both fraudulent and non-fraudulent).  
  - Mock the `detect_fraud` method to implement stub logic for testing.  
  - Configure the Kafka producer as an output sink.  

  **Act:**  
  - Invoke `main()` while ensuring data flows through the pipeline with detection logic applied.  

  **Assert:**  
  - Verify that only transactions marked as `"fraud": True` are sent to the "alerts" topic by capturing the data in the producer sink.  

**Validation:**  
  - Fraudulent transaction detection is core to the pipeline's business logic. This test ensures that only flagged transactions progress through the pipeline, meeting fraud detection requirements.

---

### Scenario 2: Validate JSON Parsing Handling in Kafka Stream
**Details:**  
  **TestName**: test_json_parsing_error_handling  
  **Description**: Ensures that malformed JSON records are handled gracefully without crashing the pipeline.

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:**  
  - Mock Kafka consumer with sample records, including improperly formatted JSON strings (e.g., missing braces, invalid characters).  

  **Act:**  
  - Execute the pipeline and monitor its behavior when encountering malformed JSON records.  

  **Assert:**  
  - Confirm that malformed records are either ignored or produce controlled error logging, ensuring the pipeline does not halt.  

**Validation:**  
  - Robust error handling for parsing ensures pipeline reliability, as real-world data rarely guarantees clean input formatting.

---

### Scenario 3: Ensure No Data Loss During Processing
**Details:**  
  **TestName**: test_no_data_loss_in_pipeline  
  **Description**: This test verifies that all incoming valid transactions, whether flagged or not flagged as fraudulent, are processed through the pipeline without data loss.

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:**  
  - Mock Kafka consumer with a known count of valid transactions (including both flagged and unflagged).  
  - Mock Kafka producer to capture all processed records.  

  **Act:**  
  - Execute the pipeline with controlled data streams.  

  **Assert:**  
  - Verify the total number of records in the producer sink matches the count of valid input records from the consumer.  

**Validation:**  
  - Ensures that the pipeline processes all valid input data fully, meeting reliability and integrity requirements.

---

### Scenario 4: Multi-Transaction Fraud Identification
**Details:**  
  **TestName**: test_multiple_fraudulent_transactions  
  **Description**: Ensures that the pipeline processes multiple flagged transactions correctly and emits all alerts to the producer sink.  

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:**  
  - Mock Kafka consumer with a stream of JSON transactions where multiple records are flagged as `"fraud": True`.  

  **Act:**  
  - Execute the pipeline and let the transactions pass through the fraud detection and filtering logic.  

  **Assert:**  
  - Confirm that all flagged transactions are present in the producer sink and formatted as JSON strings.  

**Validation:**  
  - This test is critical to ensure the pipeline's scalability and correctness when processing multiple fraud alerts simultaneously.

---

### Scenario 5: Verify Execution Environment Integration
**Details:**  
  **TestName**: test_pipeline_execution_environment_setup  
  **Description**: Ensures that the execution environment is correctly set up to support stream processing.

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:**  
  - Initialize the `StreamExecutionEnvironment` and attach mock Kafka connectors.  
  - Stub the `env.execute()` method to verify its invocation.  

  **Act:**  
  - Execute the pipeline using the `main()` function.  

  **Assert:**  
  - Verify that the execution environment is successfully created and `env.execute()` is called once.  

**Validation:**  
  - Proper setup of the execution environment is essential for the pipeline's initialization and runtime execution.

---

### Scenario 6: Fraudulent Transaction to Alerts Mapping Correctness
**Details:**  
  **TestName**: test_fraudulent_transaction_mapping  
  **Description**: Ensures that flagged transactions are properly transformed into JSON string alerts before being sent to the "alerts" topic.

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:**  
  - Mock Kafka consumer with sample flagged transactions.  
  - Setup a producer sink to capture output alerts.  

  **Act:**  
  - Execute the pipeline and monitor the transformation stage.  

  **Assert:**  
  - Verify that the output format accurately matches the expected JSON string structure for alerts.  

**Validation:**  
  - Ensures the integrity of the output data structure, supporting downstream processing or logging.

---

### Scenario 7: Handle Empty Kafka Topic Input
**Details:**  
  **TestName**: test_empty_kafka_topic  
  **Description**: Tests how the pipeline handles a scenario where the "transactions" topic contains no data.

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:**  
  - Mock Kafka consumer with an empty data stream.  

  **Act:**  
  - Execute the pipeline and let the stream flow through processing stages.  

  **Assert:**  
  - Confirm that no output is sent to the producer sink and the pipeline completes execution without errors.  

**Validation:**  
  - Ensures the pipeline functions gracefully under minimal input scenarios.

---

### Scenario 8: Validate Fraud Detection Logging
**Details:**  
  **TestName**: test_fraud_detection_logging  
  **Description**: Tests whether proper logs are generated when fraud detection logic flags transactions as suspicious.

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:**  
  - Mock the `detect_fraud` method to flag a known set of test transactions.  
  - Setup logging mechanisms to capture messages.  

  **Act:**  
  - Execute the pipeline and induce fraud detection events.  

  **Assert:**  
  - Validate the presence of log messages indicating flagged transactions and their details.  

**Validation:**  
  - Transparent logging supports auditing and better debugging for flagged transactions.

---

### Scenario 9: High Throughput Data Handling
**Details:**  
  **TestName**: test_high_throughput_handling  
  **Description**: Validates the pipeline's ability to handle high volumes of incoming data without performance degradation or errors.

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:**  
  - Mock Kafka consumer with a high volume of transaction data.  
  - Monitor resource utilization and producer sink outputs.  

  **Act:**  
  - Execute `main()` with streaming input at high throughput rates.  

  **Assert:**  
  - Ensure the pipeline processes all data accurately and outputs alerts for flagged transactions within acceptable performance thresholds.  

**Validation:**  
  - Critical for scalability and real-world production readiness of the fraud detection pipeline.

--- 

### General Guidelines for Test Code Creation:
1. **Focus on Business Logic Validation:** Ensure all tests align with the purpose of fraud detection, filtering, and alert generation.
2. **Mock Dependencies:** Mock all external components (Kafka consumer, producer, and `detect_fraud`) to control the input, output, and behavior.
3. **Test for Reliability:** Include scenarios for error handling, empty topics, malformed data, and high throughput to validate pipeline robustness.
4. **Validate Data Integrity:** Assert correctness in transformation and format during every stage in the pipeline.
5. **Performance Evaluation:** Ensure pipeline execution under normal and extreme load meets expected SLAs.
6. **Logging and Monitoring:** Verify that appropriate logs are generated at key stages for debugging and auditing.
