Scenario 1: Test Scenarios for Valid Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_map_with_valid_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct result when map() is invoked with valid real numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a MapFunction object.
  Act: Call the map method with different valid numbers.
  Assert: The output should be the input number multiplied by 2.
Validation:
  This is important as we have to make sure the defined functions run as expected with valid input values.

Scenario 2: Test Scenarios for Empty Input
Details:
  TestName: test_map_with_empty_input
  Description: This test is designed to confirm the behavior of the map function when given an empty input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a MapFunction object.
  Act: Call the map method with an empty input.
  Assert: The test should throw a TypeError, as the map method is designed to operate on numbers.
Validation:
  This scenario is important because it validates how the system handles empty inputs, which is a crucial aspect of robust software testing.

Scenario 3: Test Scenarios with Zero Input
Details:
  TestName: test_map_with_zero_input
  Description: This scenario verifies whether the map() method correctly handles the special input of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the MapFunction object.
  Act: Call the map() method with zero as an argument.
  Assert: The output should be zero.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the program correctly handles zero as an input, which could potentially cause issues in some mathematical operations.

Scenario 4: Testing pointer inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_map_with_pointer_inputs
  Description: This scenario checks the behavior of map() on pointer reference inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the MapFunction object.
  Act: Call the map() method with an object or variable reference.
  Assert: The test should throw a TypeError, as the map method is not built to handle non-numeric values.
Validation:
  This validates that our function is safe from potential issues related to type checking or memory management.
