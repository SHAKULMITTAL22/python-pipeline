```
Scenario 1: Test Entire Pipeline with Simple Input
Details:
  TestName: test_run_pipeline_with_simple_input
  Description: This test aims to validate the entire pipeline function with simple numerical input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a simple list of integers for the input data.
  Act: Call the run_pipeline function with the prepared data.
  Assert: Check that the return value matches the expected result of all transformations applied in order.
Validation:
  This test verifies that each transformation in the pipeline is correctly applied to the sample data and the result reflects the consecutive application of transformations. 

Scenario 2: Test Empty Input
Details:
  TestName: test_run_pipeline_with_empty_input
  Description: This test verifies the run_pipeline function when the input data is an empty list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty list for the input data.
  Act: Call the run_pipeline function with the empty list.
  Assert: Check that the return value is also an empty list.
Validation:
  Empty input may happen in real scenarios, and the pipeline should handle it gracefully. It's necessary to ensure the pipeline does not crash or throw exceptions with empty input.

Scenario 3: Test with Both Even and Odd Numbers in Input
Details:
  TestName: test_run_pipeline_with_mixed_numbers
  Description: This test validates the run_pipeline function when the input data contains both even and odd numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of integers containing both even and odd numbers for input data.
  Act: Call the run_pipeline function with the prepared data.
  Assert: Verify that the return value reflects accurate processing of both even and odd numbers throughout the entire pipeline.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the pipeline correctly handles complex cases of containing both even and odd numbers.

Scenario 4: Test the Function With Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_run_pipeline_with_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify the run_pipeline function when the input data is a list of negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of negative integers for input data.
  Act: Call the run_pipeline function with the prepared data.
  Assert: Check the return value matches the expected result after all transformations.
Validation:
  As negative numbers can also be valid input, it's important to test this scenario to make sure the pipeline functions correctly with negative integers.

Scenario 5: Test Timestamp Functionality of CustomProcessFunction
Details:
  TestName: test_run_pipeline_timestamp_functionality
  Description: This test is intended to verify the timestamp functionality implemented in CustomProcessFunction works correctly along with the pipeline.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of integers for input data.
  Act: Call the run_pipeline function with the prepared data.
  Assert: Check that each line of the result contains a timestamp as expected.
Validation:
  As the timestamp functionality in CustomProcessFunction can be critical for certain business logic depending on the time of event occurrence, it's essential to make sure it works as expected.
