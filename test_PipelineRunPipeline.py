### Test Scenarios for `run_pipeline`

---

#### Scenario 1: Verify Correct Multiplication by Two Transformation
**Details:**  
  **TestName:** test_map_transformation_multiply_by_two  
  **Description:** Validate that the `MultiplyByTwo` transformation correctly doubles the integers in the input collection. This tests whether the first map operation is applied successfully.  

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:** Provide an input dataset that includes positive integers, negative integers, and zero (e.g., `[0, 1, -2, 5]`).     
  **Act:** Invoke `run_pipeline(data)` with the prepared dataset as the input.  
  **Assert:** Check that after processing the `MultiplyByTwo` map transformation, the resulting integers are accurately doubled (e.g., `[0, 2, -4, 10]`).  

**Validation:**  
The `MultiplyByTwo` operation is the initial step in the pipeline, and correctness is essential as subsequent transformations depend on its output. Incorrect behavior here would invalidate the entire processing chain.  

---

#### Scenario 2: Verify Expansion to Range Transformation
**Details:**  
  **TestName:** test_flat_map_transformation_expand_to_range  
  **Description:** Validate that `ExpandToRange` correctly expands each integer into a sequence of values based on its logic.  

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:** Provide a dataset with integers known to produce predictable ranges (e.g., `[2, 4]`).  
  **Act:** Invoke `run_pipeline(data)` with the input dataset.  
  **Assert:** Verify that each integer is expanded to a series of values as specified by the `ExpandToRange` transformation (e.g., `[2, 4]` might become `[2, 3, 4, 5, ..., N]`).  

**Validation:**  
Correct range expansion is necessary for creating input diversity for subsequent filtering and keying operations. This transformation's result influences all subsequent computations.  

---

#### Scenario 3: Validate Even Number Filtering
**Details:**  
  **TestName:** test_filter_transformation_is_even  
  **Description:** Ensure that the `IsEven` filter correctly excludes odd numbers from the pipeline.  

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:** Provide an input dataset containing both even and odd integers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).  
  **Act:** Invoke `run_pipeline(data)` with this dataset.  
  **Assert:** Confirm that only even integers remain in the intermediate dataset (e.g., `[2, 4]`).  

**Validation:**  
Confirming the `IsEven` logic is critical to ensure only valid data progresses to subsequent transformations (such as keying and reducing).  

---

#### Scenario 4: Verify Correct Key Assignment Using ModuloKeySelector
**Details:**  
  **TestName:** test_key_by_modulo_key_selector  
  **Description:** Ensure that the `ModuloKeySelector` correctly assigns keys to each element for downstream reduction based on their modulo value.  

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:** Provide a dataset containing diverse integers (e.g., `[2, 4, 6, 8]`) and specify the modulo logic.  
  **Act:** Invoke `run_pipeline(data)` with the prepared dataset.  
  **Assert:** Verify that integers are grouped correctly by their modulo result, e.g., for modulo 2, all even numbers should be assigned the same key.  

**Validation:**  
Correct key assignment is necessary for proper grouping and accurate reduction operations. Errors at this stage would disrupt aggregation results.  

---

#### Scenario 5: Verify SumReducer Aggregates Correctly
**Details:**  
  **TestName:** test_reduce_transformation_sum_reducer  
  **Description:** Validate the behavior of the `SumReducer` in aggregating values within each key group produced by `ModuloKeySelector`.  

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:** Provide a dataset of integers that produce a predictable result when summed within their respective groups (e.g., `[2, 4, 6, 8]` with modulo 2).  
  **Act:** Invoke `run_pipeline(data)` with this dataset.  
  **Assert:** Ensure that the output is the sum of integers within each key group, e.g., `[20]` for modulo 2.  

**Validation:**  
Accurate aggregation is vital for summarizing data and producing meaningful results. This operation should produce correct sums for downstream consumption or final output.  

---

#### Scenario 6: Verify Correct Processing Using `CustomProcessFunction`
**Details:**  
  **TestName:** test_process_function_output_format  
  **Description:** Ensure that `CustomProcessFunction` effectively processes and transforms the reduced results into the expected string format.  

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:** Provide a dataset that results in predictable grouping, reduction, and final output after applying `CustomProcessFunction`.  
  **Act:** Invoke `run_pipeline(data)` with this dataset.  
  **Assert:** Verify that the final results match the expected custom format, e.g., `["Key: Modulo_2, Value: 20"]`.  

**Validation:**  
This step ensures proper integration between reductions and final output formatting, satisfying end-user requirements for readable or structured results.  

---

#### Scenario 7: Validate Handling of Empty Input
**Details:**  
  **TestName:** test_pipeline_with_empty_input  
  **Description:** Confirm that the pipeline handles empty datasets gracefully without errors and produces an empty result.  

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:** Provide an empty dataset as input (`[]`).  
  **Act:** Invoke `run_pipeline(data)` with this empty dataset.  
  **Assert:** Ensure that the pipeline returns an empty list (`[]`) with no errors.  

**Validation:**  
Handling edge cases like empty input is crucial for robust pipeline behavior, ensuring the function does not fail under atypical circumstances.  

---

#### Scenario 8: Validate Large Input Dataset Behavior
**Details:**  
  **TestName:** test_pipeline_with_large_input_dataset  
  **Description:** Test the pipeline's performance and correctness when handling a large dataset.  

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:** Provide a large dataset (e.g., `range(1, 10000)`).  
  **Act:** Invoke `run_pipeline(data)` with this dataset.  
  **Assert:** Verify that the pipeline processes all elements and that the final output matches expected results based on transformations.  

**Validation:**  
Testing large datasets ensures the pipeline's scalability and correctness under real-world conditions with significant data volumes.  

---

#### Scenario 9: Verify Non-Numeric Input Handling
**Details:**  
  **TestName:** test_pipeline_with_non_numeric_input  
  **Description:** Ensure the pipeline rejects non-numeric inputs or raises an appropriate error.  

**Execution:**  
  **Arrange:** Provide a dataset containing invalid elements (`["string", None, True]`).  
  **Act:** Invoke `run_pipeline(data)` with this dataset.  
  **Assert:** Verify that the pipeline produces a meaningful error or exception indicating invalid inputs.  

**Validation:**  
Proper error handling for unexpected data types ensures robustness and prevents silent failures in production environments.  

---

These scenarios collectively target the full functionality of `run_pipeline`, verifying correctness across all transformations and ensuring robustness under various conditions.
