```
Scenario 1: Test for Zero Input data
Details:
  TestName: test_run_pipeline_with_zero
  Description: This test will verify the ability of the function run_pipeline to handle input that results in zero after multiplication and division.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an input array of single element [0].
  Act: Call the function run_pipeline with the initialized array.
  Assert: Check whether the result comes out to be zero. It should be 'Element: 0, Timestamp: {current_timestamp}'.
Validation:
  If zero is an input, the method should successfully operate the transformations and produce zero regardless of the data transformations.

Scenario 2: Test the return of the odd number
Details:
  TestName: test_no_even_number_return
  Description: The test will confirm the function's IsEven and key_by methods avoid odd numbers and correctly execute the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an array with only odd numbers.
  Act: Call the run_pipeline function on the array.
  Assert: Check that the returned result is empty.
Validation:
  The filter and key_by methods in the function should correctly filter out odd numbers, and thus the result set should be empty when only inputting odd numbers.

Scenario 3: MultiplyByTwo and ExpandToRange functionality
Details:
  TestName: test_multiply_and_range
  Description: The test will validate the MultiplyByTwo and ExpandToRange methods can correctly transform input data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of small integers.
  Act: Call the run_pipeline function on the list.
  Assert: Confirm that the output has correctly doubled values and has expanded according to the range.
Validation:
  This is crucial to verify that the map and flat_map transformations within the pipeline function correctly and produce expected results for a known input set.

Scenario 4: Validate CustomProcessFunction outcome
Details:
  TestName: test_process_element
  Description: The test verifies that the CustomProcessFunction correctly formats its string outputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass in a known set of integer values in a list.
  Act: Call the run_pipeline function with the already known list.
  Assert: Check that the output features formatted strings with correct timestamps.
Validation:
  Verifying the process function in the pipeline is crucial to ensure that the final output is being formatted correctly according to the business needs.

Scenario 5: Validate Reducer function
Details:
  TestName: test_sum_reducer
  Description: The test will confirm whether the SumReducer can accurately sum repeated values within the data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize array with duplicate values.
  Act: Call the run_pipeline function on the array.
  Assert: Confirm that the duplicated data has been reduced by accurate summing.
Validation:
  The test will determine whether the reduction step in the pipeline is functioning correctly, which is crucial for maintaining accurate data state.

"""
NOTE: In each test, the timestamp is computed at the time of the test run and hence used round(time.time() * 1000) to calculate the timestamp at the test run. This approach of inferring timestamps will depend directly on the 'CustomProcessFunction' implementation.
