``` 
Scenario 1: Validation of Map Transformation
Details:
  TestName: test_map_transformation
  Description: This test verifies the correct functioning of the map transformation. The MultiplyByTwo() operation should double all integers in the input data.
Execution:
  Arrange: A list of integers will be passed to the run_pipeline function.
  Act: The run_pipeline function will be invoked with the list of integers.
  Assert: The output list of integers should be the doubled version of each respective input number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the MultiplyByTwo() transformation is working appropriately. If the function is incorrect, any calculations using the output of this step will be incorrect.

Scenario 2: Validation of FlatMap Transformation
Details:
  TestName: test_flatmap_transformation
  Description: This test verifies the functional correctness of the flatmap transformation, ensuring that the ExpandToRange() operation outputs a range of numbers from zero to the input number.
Execution:
  Arrange: An array of integers will be prepared and passed to the run_pipeline function.
  Act: The run_pipeline function is called with the list of integers.
  Assert: The output should be a list of numbers with elements representing ranges from 0 to each original integer (exclusive).
Validation:
  This test validates the proper functioning of the flatmap transformation. It is crucial to ensure the ExpandToRange() operation is behaving correctly to maintain data integrity and fulfill business needs.

Scenario 3: Validation of Filter Transformation
Details:
  TestName: test_filter_transformation
  Description: This test ensures that the IsEven() operation correctly filters out odd numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array of random integers and run the function run_pipeline().
  Act: invoke the run_pipeline function using the created list.
  Assert: The output list should contain only even numbers.
Validation:
  Verify that the filter function works correctly and discards all odd numbers, ensuring correctness and integrity of the pipeline.

Scenario 4: Validation of KeyBy and Reduce Transformation
Details:
  TestName: test_keyby_reduce_transformation
  Description: This test investigates the correctness of the key_by and reduce transformation. The function SumReducer() should correctly consolidate data with the same key and reduce them.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of integers and feed it to the run_pipeline function.
  Act: Call the run_pipeline function using the arranged list.
  Assert: The output should be a reduced list where the integers having the same modulo value are summed up.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for validating the run_pipeline function's ability to group similar integers and summarize them accurately. This ensures correct data processing and meets business requirements.

Scenario 5: Validation of Process Function Transformation
Details:
  TestName: test_processfunction_transformation
  Description: This test checks the correctness of the CustomProcessFunction() operation. It should correctly transform the input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a list of integers and pass it to the run_pipeline function.
  Act: Run the run_pipeline function with the given list.
  Assert: The expected output should be in accordance with the specific transformation rule described by CustomProcessFunction().
Validation:
  This test ensures that the final transformation in the data pipeline - process function, is implemented correctly and converts the data as per the business logic defined in the CustomProcessFunction().
