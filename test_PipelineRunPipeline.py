Scenario 1: Validate the Transformation of Even Numbers into Double
Details:
  TestName: test_transform_to_double
  Description: Verify that the run_pipeline function applies the MultiplyByTwo() transformation accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the data variable with an array of even numbers
  Act: Invoke the run_pipeline function with the data variable.
  Assert: Check that all numbers in the returned array are doubled.
Validation:
  The multiplying operation is a key feature of the function. The test will verify that even input numbers are properly doubled, ensuring the function's correctness in this aspect.

Scenario 2: Validate the Flatten Operation with ExpandToRange
Details:
  TestName: test_faltten_operation
  Description: Validate that the ExpandToRange() operation flattens the mapped numbers to the specified range.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the data variable with an array of integers.
  Act: Invoke the run_pipeline function with the data variable.
  Assert: Check that the returned flattened array of integers falls in the specified range.
Validation:
  The function should be able to correctly flatten the input data array based on defined rules. The validation of this functionality ensures the accuracy and reliability of the operation.

Scenario 3: Validate Filtering of Odd Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_filter_odd_numbers
  Description: Ensure that the run_pipeline function filters all odd numbers out of the array after the map and flat_map operations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the input data array with both even and odd numbers.
  Act: Invoke the run_pipeline function with the prepared data array.
  Assert: Check that the returned array contains no odd numbers.
Validation:
  The filtering operation is critical in the data transformation process. This test verifies that the function accurately filters odd numbers.  
   
Scenario 4: Validate the Key and Reduce Operation
Details:
  TestName: test_key_and_reduce_operation
  Description: Verify that every grouped data (even/odd) is accurately reduced.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initiate the input data array with both even and odd numbers.
  Act: Invoke the run_pipeline function with the prepared data array.
  Assert: Verify that the returned array is correctly reduced based on the even/odd separation.
Validation:
  It ensures that the reduce operation over the grouped data (even/odd integers) is carried out accurately. It maintains the function's reliability in data group management and operations.
   
Scenario 5: Validate the Process Function and Time Stamp Addition
Details:
  TestName: test_process_function_operation
  Description: Validate the CustomProcessFunction that concatenates the input data with the current timestamp.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the data variable with a random input array.
  Act: Invoke the run_pipeline function with the data variable.
  Assert: Verify that all returned string values contain the correct number and timestamp.
Validation:
  The process function is integral to the data transformation, affecting the final output structure. Ensuring its accuracy validates both correct function behavior and accurate timestamp generation.
