Scenario 1: Verify map transformation of MultiplyByTwo
Details:
  TestName: test_map_transformation_multiply_by_two
  Description: This test will verify if the incoming data elements are correctly multiplied by two.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a set of integer data elements.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared integer data.
  Assert: Check whether each element in the output list is twice its corresponding data in the input list.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the MultiplyByTwo transformation is applied correctly to the input data, as the correct multiplication of each data element by two is a fundamental step of the business logic encapsulated by the run_pipeline function.

Scenario 2: Verify flat_map transformation of ExpandToRange
Details:
  TestName: test_flat_map_transformation_expand_to_range
  Description: This test will ensure that the ExpandToRange flat_map transformation correctly generates a range of numbers for each number in the input data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of integers.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared integer data.
  Assert: Check if the output list correctly encompasses the sequence of each number in the input data.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the ExpandToRange transformation works as expected, generating a range of numbers for each input number for further transformations.

Scenario 3: Verify correctness of IsEven filter function
Details:
  TestName: test_filter_function_is_even
  Description: This test will ensure that the IsEven filter transformation correctly filters out odd numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of integers.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared data.
  Assert: Verify that the output list contains only even numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures the proper operation of the IsEven filter transformation, an essential part of the pipeline since it determines which numbers will proceed for key and reduce transformations.

Scenario 4: Verify key_by and SumReducer transformations
Details:
  TestName: test_key_and_sum_reducer_transformations
  Description: This test will ensure that the data is correctly grouped by key (ModuloKeySelector) and the values of each group are summarized(SumReducer).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of integers.
  Act: Invoke the run_pipeline function with the prepared data.
  Assert: Confirm that the grouped and summarized output corresponds to the expected result of grouping and summing up the input values based on their modulo 2 value.
Validation:
  This test is necessary to ensure that keying and reduction operations are applied accurately, influencing the final outcome of the run_pipeline function.

Scenario 5: Verify the CustomProcessFunction result
Details:
  TestName: test_custom_process_function_result
  Description: This test is to check if the CustomProcessFunction correctly appends timestamp to each data element.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of integers.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared integer data.
  Assert: Confirm each output string correctly corresponds to each integer data element suffixed with the timestamp.
Validation:
  This test ensures that CustomProcessFunction functions as expected, finalizing the pipeline transformation process by formatting its output.
