Scenario 1: Verifying pipeline execution on valid integer data
Details:
  TestName: test_run_pipeline_with_valid_integer_data
  Description: This test verifies that the run_pipeline function can process a list of integers and apply the MultiplyByTwo transformation correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of integers as input.  
  Act: Invoke the run_pipeline function with the input list. 
  Assert: Ensure the output list has the same size as the input and all values are correctly doubled. 
Validation:
  Rationale: This scenario is critical, as it tests the core functionality of the algorithm under normal conditions. The expected result is a doubling of all input integer values, reflecting the behavior of the MultiplyByTwo transformation.

Scenario 2: Verifying pipeline execution on empty data
Details:
  TestName: test_run_pipeline_with_empty_data
  Description: This test verifies that the run_pipeline function can handle an empty input list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty list as the input.
  Act: Invoke the run_pipeline function with the empty list.
  Assert: Ensure the output list is also empty.
Validation:
  Rationale: This scenario is significant as it checks for corner cases where the input list may be empty, preventing potential issues in the production environment. An empty list as input should return an empty list as output.

Scenario 3: Verifying pipeline execution with mixture of positive and negative integers.
Details:
  TestName: test_run_pipeline_with_mixed_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the run_pipeline function works correctly even when input data include negative and positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list that includes both positive and negative integers.
  Act: Invoke the run_pipeline function with the initialized list.
  Assert: Verify that the output list contains the corresponding doubled values of the input list including the negative values.
Validation:
  Rationale: Testing the pipeline with both positive and negative integers will verify that the multiply by two transformation is applied correctly for all integer values.

Scenario 4: Verifying pipeline execution with large integer data
Details:
  TestName: test_run_pipeline_with_large_integer_data
  Description: This test verifies that the run_pipeline function can correctly handle and process a large integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list with a large integer value as the input.
  Act: Invoke the run_pipeline function with the list containing the large integer.
  Assert: Ensure the output contains the correctly doubled large integer value.
Validation:
  Rationale: This scenario is important because it checks how the pipeline handles large integer values; this is an edge case scenario that tests the limit of the function's ability to handle big figures.
