### Scenario 1: Verify the function correctly splits a sentence with multiple spaces
Details:
  **TestName**: test_multiple_spaces
  **Description**: Ensure that the function correctly handles sentences with multiple spaces between words and collects all valid words without including extra spaces.
Execution:
  **Arrange**: Initialize a `WordExtractor` and a dummy `collector`. Provide a string with multiple spaces between words as input.
  **Act**: Call `flat_map` with the input string and the collector.
  **Assert**: Check that `collector.items` contains all the words split by spaces without extra spaces.
Validation:  
  This test ensures the robustness of the function when handling inconsistent spacing, which is common in user-provided text data.

---

### Scenario 2: Validate behavior with an empty input string
Details:
  **TestName**: test_empty_input
  **Description**: Verify that the function handles empty strings gracefully and does not attempt to collect any items.
Execution:
  **Arrange**: Initialize a `WordExtractor` and a dummy `collector`. Provide an empty string as input.
  **Act**: Call `flat_map` with the empty string and the collector.
  **Assert**: Confirm that `collector.items` remains empty.
Validation:  
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles edge cases with no data and does not fail unexpectedly.

---

### Scenario 3: Verify the function's behavior with a single-word input
Details:
  **TestName**: test_single_word_input
  **Description**: Ensure that the function processes and collects a single word correctly.
Execution:
  **Arrange**: Initialize a `WordExtractor` and a dummy `collector`. Provide a single word as input.
  **Act**: Call `flat_map` with the input word and the collector.
  **Assert**: Check that `collector.items` contains just the single word.
Validation:  
  Single-word inputs represent the most basic use case, and ensuring correct behavior here verifies foundational functionality.

---

### Scenario 4: Validate handling of punctuation and special characters in input strings
Details:
  **TestName**: test_punctuation_handling
  **Description**: Test how the function processes words with punctuation and special characters, ensuring that they are not improperly split or ignored.
Execution:
  **Arrange**: Initialize a `WordExtractor` and a dummy `collector`. Provide a string with punctuation (e.g., `"Hello, world!"`) as input.
  **Act**: Call `flat_map` with the input string and the collector.
  **Assert**: Confirm that `collector.items` contains words split by spaces, including punctuations as part of the words.
Validation:  
  This test verifies the method's compliance with expected business logic when encountering punctuation, ensuring realistic processing of raw text data.

---

### Scenario 5: Ensure the function processes multiline strings correctly
Details:
  **TestName**: test_multiline_strings
  **Description**: Verify that the function can process and split words correctly across multiple lines, treating whitespace and newline characters consistently.
Execution:
  **Arrange**: Initialize a `WordExtractor` and a dummy `collector`. Provide a multiline string (e.g., `"Hello\nworld"`) as input.
  **Act**: Call `flat_map` with the multiline string and the collector.
  **Assert**: Confirm that `collector.items` contains all words split by spaces or newline characters.
Validation:  
  Multiline inputs are common in real-world textual data. Verifying consistency ensures the function provides accurate results across varied formats.

---

### Scenario 6: Validate the function when input includes numeric values
Details:
  **TestName**: test_numeric_values
  **Description**: Ensure the function does not discriminate against numeric values and correctly processes and collects them as valid "words."
Execution:  
  **Arrange**: Initialize a `WordExtractor` and a dummy `collector`. Provide a string containing numeric values (e.g., `"123 456 test"`) as input.
  **Act**: Call `flat_map` with the input string and the collector.  
  **Assert**: Confirm that `collector.items` includes numeric strings without alteration.
Validation:  
  Numbers are often present in textual data, and verifying that they are treated consistently validates the function’s completeness.

---

### Scenario 7: Test behavior with words containing special characters like underscores or hyphens
Details:
  **TestName**: test_special_character_words
  **Description**: Ensure the function correctly processes words containing special characters (e.g., `"user_name"`, `"well-being"`) without splitting them improperly.
Execution:
  **Arrange**: Initialize a `WordExtractor` and a dummy `collector`. Provide a string containing words with special characters as input.
  **Act**: Call `flat_map` with the input string and the collector.
  **Assert**: Check that `collector.items` includes words containing special characters in their entirety.
Validation:  
  Special characters are common in modern text and can represent semantic importance. This test ensures integrity when processing such words.

---

### Scenario 8: Verify behavior with input containing non-English characters
Details:
  **TestName**: test_non_english_characters
  **Description**: Ensure that the function correctly handles Unicode, such as non-English or accented characters (e.g., `"Bonjour, ça va?"`).
Execution:
  **Arrange**: Initialize a `WordExtractor` and dummy `collector`. Provide a string containing Unicode characters as input.
  **Act**: Call `flat_map` with the Unicode input string and the collector.
  **Assert**: Confirm that `collector.items` includes all words split by spaces, maintaining Unicode characters.
Validation:  
  Validating Unicode handling supports internationalization and ensures compatibility with diverse languages.

---

### Scenario 9: Confirm performance with very large input strings
Details:
  **TestName**: test_large_input_string
  **Description**: Verify the function processes a large input efficiently without errors or excessive delays.
Execution:
  **Arrange**: Initialize a `WordExtractor` and dummy `collector`. Create a string with thousands of words as input.
  **Act**: Call `flat_map` with the large input string and the collector.
  **Assert**: Confirm that `collector.items` contains all words from the input string.
Validation:  
  Performance testing is critical for ensuring scalability and appropriate functionality under high data loads.

--- 

### Scenario 10: Validate behavior when the collector is not functional or broken
Details:
  **TestName**: test_broken_collector
  **Description**: Test the function's behavior when the collector has errors (e.g., lacks a valid `collect` method).
Execution:
  **Arrange**: Initialize a `WordExtractor` and an improperly implemented collector (e.g., missing the `collect` method).
  **Act**: Call `flat_map` with valid input and the broken collector.
  **Assert**: Expect an exception or error due to collector misconfiguration.
Validation:  
  This tests defensive programming and error handling, ensuring the function responds gracefully to dependency issues.

#    def flat_map(self, value, collector):
#        for word in value.split():
#            collector.collect(word)
# 3. If PyFlink is not installed in the environment, install it using pip:
